title: "User Registration & Identity Creation"
description: "How users create their sovereign digital identity without central servers"

Unlike traditional applications that require registering
with central servers, Osvauld users create their own cryptographic
identity locally. There's no signup form, no email verification, just the generation of cryptographic keys that serve as your digital identity.

## The Triple-Key Architecture

Every user generates three distinct cryptographic key pairs, each serving a specific purpose:

### 1. PGP Certificate (Identity & Encryption)

Your foundational identity is a PGP certificate generated using the Cv25519 cipher suite. This certificate serves dual purposes:
- **Identity**: Mathematical proof of who you are
- **Encryption**: Protects your data and encrypts keys shared with you

The certificate includes your username and creates both signing and encryption subkeys, giving you complete cryptographic identity capabilities.

### 2. Device Key (Node Identification)

Each device generates its own Ed25519 key pair for P2P networking. This key:
- **Identifies your device** on the Iroh P2P network
- **Encrypts QUIC channels** for secure peer connections

Every device you use (laptop, desktop, phone) gets its own unique device key,
but they're all linked to your main PGP identity.

### 3. UCAN Key (Permissions & Delegation)

The UCAN key is deterministically derived from your PGP certificate using Argon2 key derivation with domain separation. This ensures consistency across devices while maintaining security. This key:
- **Issues UCAN tokens** for resource access
- **Delegates permissions** to other users
- **Validates capability chains** cryptographically

Since it's derived from your PGP certificate, you'll have the same UCAN identity on every device without needing to sync additional keys.

## Password-Based Key Protection

All your private keys are encrypted with your password using Argon2 key derivation and AES-256-GCM encryption. The process:

1. **Salt Generation**: A random 16-byte salt is created for your account
2. **Key Derivation**: Your password and salt generate an AES encryption key via Argon2
3. **Encryption**: All private key material is encrypted with this AES key
4. **Storage**: Only encrypted keys are stored in your local database

Only when you enter your password can the keys be decrypted and used. This ensures that even if your device is compromised, your identity remains secure without the password.


## What Makes This Different

Traditional registration creates an account on someone else's server. Osvauld registration creates a complete cryptographic identity that belongs entirely to you:

**No Central Authority**: Your identity isn't verified by a company - it's mathematically proven by cryptographic signatures.

**No Account Recovery**: There's no "forgot password" because there's no server storing your credentials. Your password is the only way to access your keys.

**Cross-Device Consistency**: The UCAN key derivation ensures you have the same permission identity across all your devices.

**Complete Ownership**: You own your identity certificate and can use it with any compatible application, not just Osvauld.

## Security Implications

This approach provides stronger security than traditional systems:

- **No Password Database**: There's no central database of passwords to be breached
- **No Identity Theft**: Your identity can't be stolen from a third party because no third party stores it
- **Forward Secrecy**: Even if a device is compromised, past communications remain secure
- **Cryptographic Proof**: Your identity is mathematical fact, not corporate assertion

The trade-off is responsibility: you must securely store your encrypted keys and remember your password. There's no customer support to call if you lose access - but there's also no company that can lock you out of your own identity.

## What Happens Next

Once your identity is created, you can:
- Create and collaborate on documents
- Connect directly with other users
- Share resources through cryptographic permissions
- Add additional devices to your identity
- Join sovereign nodes for backup and availability

Your cryptographic identity becomes the foundation for all sovereign applications - not just Osvauld's current document editor, but any future application that respects user sovereignty.
