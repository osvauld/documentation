---

Libremot is a **peer-to-peer encrypted chat application** that uses the same Osvauld protocol as Livnote and Sthalam. Each chat is a CRDT document that synchronizes across peers in real-time.

## How It Works

**CRDT-Based Chat**: Each conversation is a conflict-free replicated data type (CRDT) document. When you send a message, you're editing the shared CRDT document—changes sync automatically across all participants.

**Same Protocol**: Libremot uses the same peer-to-peer infrastructure as Livnote:
- Self-sovereign identity (PGP keys, Ed25519)
- Direct peer-to-peer connections
- End-to-end encryption
- No central servers required

**Group Chats**: Supports group conversations with multiple participants. All group members edit the same CRDT document, keeping everyone synchronized.

## Key Features

**Real-Time Synchronization**: Messages appear instantly across all connected peers through CRDT operations.

**End-to-End Encrypted**: All messages are encrypted end-to-end. Only participants with access to the shared CRDT document can read the conversation.

**Offline Support**: Messages queue locally when peers are offline and sync automatically when connections restore.

**Single Identity**: Use the same identity across Livnote, Libremot, and Sthalam—no separate logins required.

## Architecture

Libremot treats chat as a specialized type of collaborative editing:

**Chat as Document Editing**: Each message is an operation on the shared CRDT document. The same synchronization engine that powers Livnote's collaborative documents powers Libremot's chat.

**Group Conversations**: Multiple peers can participate in the same conversation. The CRDT ensures all messages arrive in consistent order without conflicts.

**Protocol Reuse**: By using the same underlying protocol, Libremot benefits from all the security and synchronization features built for Livnote.

This architecture means chat is just another form of peer-to-peer collaboration—with the same privacy, sovereignty, and direct connections that define the Osvauld ecosystem.
