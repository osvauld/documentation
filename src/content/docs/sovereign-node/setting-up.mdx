title: "Setting Up Sovereign Nodes (Proof of Concept)"
description: "Experimental always-online infrastructure for testing backup and synchronization concepts"
---

Sovereign nodes are an experimental CLI application that demonstrates how self-hosted infrastructure could provide always-online backup and synchronization services for Osvauld networks. This is currently a proof-of-concept implementation to test the viability of user-controlled infrastructure in P2P collaborative networks.

**⚠️ Development Status: This is experimental software not intended for production use. The security model and functionality are still evolving.**

## Current Proof-of-Concept Model

The current sovereign node implementation operates as a regular peer with full access to shared documents, serving as a technology demonstration for future infrastructure capabilities.

### Current Architecture

**Full Peer Access**: Nodes currently receive the same permissions and data access as any regular collaborator, including persistent access to encryption keys.

**Standard Synchronization**: Uses the existing P2P synchronization protocols without special infrastructure optimizations.

**Experimental Features**: Provides a testing ground for concepts like always-online availability and backup storage in a P2P context.

### Future Security Model (In Development)

The planned production model will implement session-based key sharing:

**Temporary Access**: Sovereign nodes will only receive decryption keys when other peers are actively online and grant session-based access.

**No Persistent Keys**: Nodes will not store long-term access to encrypted data, requiring active peer presence for decryption capabilities.

**Session-Based Permissions**: Access to document content will be granted temporarily during active collaboration sessions rather than as permanent shares.

## Experimental Setup Process

### Testing Hardware

For experimental deployment, minimal hardware is sufficient:

**Development Boards**: Raspberry Pi 4 or similar ARM-based computers work well for testing the concept.

**Network Access**: Standard internet connection for P2P connectivity testing.

**Storage**: Basic storage for SQLite database and document testing.

**Memory**: 2GB RAM sufficient for proof-of-concept operation.

## Experimental Installation

### Development Setup

Build from source for experimental use:

```bash
# Install cross for ARM64 compilation
cargo install cross

# Clone the repository (example path)
git clone https://github.com/osvauld/osvauld
cd osvauld/kunki

# Cross-compile for Raspberry Pi (ARM64)
cross build --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu --release

# Copy binary to target device
scp target/aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/kunki pi@raspberrypi.local:/home/pi/
ssh pi@raspberrypi.local "sudo cp /home/pi/kunki /usr/local/bin/ && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/osvauld"
```

### Initialize Test Node

Create an experimental node identity:

```bash
kunki init --username "test-node" --passphrase "development_passphrase"
```

**Note**: This creates the same cryptographic identity as a regular user. The node will have full access to any documents shared with it.

### Start Experimental Service

Run the test node:

```bash
kunki start --passphrase "development_passphrase" --print-token
```

The `--print-token` flag generates connection information for testing peer connections.

## Current Testing Capabilities

### What Works Today

**Peer Connectivity**: Nodes successfully establish P2P connections with desktop clients using standard handshake protocols.

**Document Synchronization**: Shared documents sync to nodes and remain available when other peers go offline.

**Always-Online Testing**: Demonstrates how continuous availability could work in production systems.

**Connection Brokering**: Provides stable connection points that help other peers discover each other.

### What's Experimental

**Security Model**: Current implementation grants full persistent access to shared documents, which is not the intended production model.

**Resource Management**: No optimization for server-class operation or resource constraints.

**Monitoring**: Basic logging without production-level observability features.

## Testing with Desktop Clients

### Connecting Clients to Test Nodes

Share the generated connection token with desktop Osvauld clients to establish connections and test the peer-to-peer protocols.

### Document Sharing

Desktop users can share documents with the test node like any other collaborator. The node will receive full access and maintain synchronized copies.

### Offline Testing

Test offline scenarios by disconnecting desktop peers while keeping the node online, then reconnecting to verify synchronization works correctly.

## Limitations and Warnings

### Current Security Limitations

**Full Access Model**: Test nodes currently receive the same permanent access to documents as regular users, including persistent decryption keys.

**No Session Management**: Access is not limited to active collaboration sessions, unlike the planned production model.

**Standard Peer Protocols**: Uses regular user synchronization without infrastructure-specific optimizations.

### Development Status

**Proof of Concept**: This implementation demonstrates concepts rather than providing production-ready infrastructure.

**API Instability**: Command-line interface and functionality may change significantly as development continues.

**Limited Support**: Experimental software without production support or stability guarantees.

## Future Development Plans

### Session-Based Security Model

**Temporary Key Sharing**: Production nodes will only receive decryption keys during active peer sessions rather than permanent access.

**Active Peer Requirements**: Nodes will require at least one authorized peer to be online to access document content.

**Session Expiration**: Access will automatically expire when collaboration sessions end.

### Infrastructure Optimizations

**Resource Efficiency**: Optimizations for continuous operation on minimal hardware.

**Monitoring Integration**: Production-ready logging and observability features.

**Multi-Tenant Support**: Secure isolation for multiple user groups on shared infrastructure.

This experimental implementation provides a foundation for testing the viability of user-controlled infrastructure in peer-to-peer collaborative networks while the security model and production features continue development.
