## Why Blockchain is Essential

Blockchain integration is **essential** for making the Extended Web globally discoverable, verifiable, and auditable while preserving privacy.

## The Four Essential Capabilities

### Global Discovery

Currently, connecting requires out-of-band device key exchange (QR codes, text messages). Blockchain enables:

- **Human-readable names** - Register `@alice` or `myblog.sthalam` instead of sharing device key strings
- **Public directories** - Decentralized directory anyone can read
- **Multi-device updates** - Change nodes, update once on-chain, everyone finds you automatically

Your content stays local and encrypted. Only identity and ownership metadata goes on-chain.

### Verifiability

Blockchain provides cryptographic proof of ownership for resources. Nobody can impersonate you or claim a resource is theirs:

- **Identity verification** - Your DID recorded on-chain, nobody can impersonate you
- **Resource ownership** - Prove you created a resource, nobody can claim it's theirs
- **Permit authenticity** - Verify Permits haven't been tampered with

Anyone can verify ownership without trusting intermediaries. Actual content stays local/encrypted.

### Auditability

Transparent permission chains prevent misuse while preserving privacy:

- **Delegation history** - See how Permits were delegated
- **Public audit trails** - Anyone can verify permission flows
- **Tamper-proof history** - Can't modify past records
- **Accountability without surveillance** - See permission flows without seeing content

The Extended Web gives individuals powerful sovereignty. Blockchain provides accountability while maintaining privacy.

### Traceability

Track authorization flows without surveilling content:

- **Verify trust chains** - Confirm Permits chain back to legitimate root authority
- **Detect suspicious patterns** - Identify unusual permission grants
- **Revocation propagation** - Ensure revoked Permits are globally marked invalid

Track permission flows, not content or behavior.

## On-Chain vs Off-Chain

**On-Chain** (Public, Verifiable):
- Your DID (identity)
- Device keys (for discovery)
- Resource ownership
- Permit hashes
- Delegation history

**Off-Chain** (Local, Private, Encrypted):
- All content
- Collaboration data
- CRDT operations
- Private connections
- Usage patterns

The blockchain provides the trust layer. Your content stays sovereign.

## Privacy Preservation

Blockchain **enhances** privacy, not reduces it:

**Traditional Web**:
- Platforms surveil everything
- Behavior tracking for advertising
- No control over your data

**Extended Web + Blockchain**:
- Content stays local and encrypted
- Only ownership/authorization recorded on-chain
- No behavior tracking
- You choose what to publish publicly

## Why Not Optional?

The Extended Web needs these capabilities to function globally:

**Without Discovery** - Limited to people you know personally

**Without Verifiability** - No way to prove ownership of resources, anyone could impersonate you or claim your resources are theirs

**Without Auditability** - Misuse could happen without accountability

**Without Traceability** - Can't verify Permit chains or detect fraud

Blockchain provides the trust and discovery layer that makes decentralized systems viable at global scale.

## Summary

Blockchain integration provides:

1. **Global Discovery** - Find people and content without centralized directories
2. **Verifiability** - Cryptographic proof of ownership and identity
3. **Auditability** - Transparent permission chains prevent misuse
4. **Traceability** - Track delegation flows without surveilling content

All while preserving privacy - only identity and ownership metadata goes on-chain, all content stays local and encrypted.

The Extended Web gives you sovereignty. Blockchain makes that sovereignty globally discoverable and verifiable.

**Essential. Not optional. Privacy-preserving by design.**
