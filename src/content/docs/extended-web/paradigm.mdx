## What Is the Extended Web?

The Extended Web is a paradigm where there is no backend - all application logic is embedded in HUML templates and Permits. The Osvauld protocol executes this embedded logic. Data lives with you, and collaboration happens peer-to-peer.

## The Extended Web Paradigm

Extended Web applications work like this:

1. **No backend** - Application logic is embedded in HUML templates (rendering logic) and Permits (merge logic). Permits are derivative of HUML. The Osvauld protocol executes this embedded logic.
2. **Data lives with you** - Your content is stored locally, syncing peer-to-peer
3. **Identity comes from cryptography** - You exist through Ed25519 keys you control
4. **Collaboration is direct** - Peer-to-peer connections using Iroh protocol

You run a personal node for always-on connectivity. It's your device, under your control - an extension of you, not a third-party server.

**Essential infrastructure**: You need at least one personal node for flawless operation. The node handles all distribution between users.

## How Extended Web Applications Work

### Local-First Operation

Extended Web applications work offline by default. There is no backend - all application logic is embedded in HUML templates and Permits. When you open an Extended Web app:

- Reads HUML templates (rendering logic) and Permits (merge logic)
- Reads data from your local storage
- The Osvauld protocol executes the embedded logic to render the interface
- Processes your edits locally - protocol executes merge logic from Permits
- Connects to network when you want to sync or collaborate

Everything works offline. Internet enables sharing, not basic functionality. No remote logic execution required.

### Peer-to-Peer Synchronization

When you collaborate, your devices connect directly using Iroh (built on QUIC). Peer-to-peer connections - no intermediary processes your content.

Your personal node facilitates:
- **Store-and-forward** - Buffers updates when you're offline
- **Relay** - Helps establish direct connections through NAT traversal
- **Public hosting** - Serves content to viewers
- **CRDT sync hub** - Coordinates conflict-free merging
- **Distribution** - Handles all distribution between users

Your personal infrastructure. You own and control it.

### Cryptographic Authorization

Extended Web apps use **Permits** - cryptographically signed bearer tokens containing all authorization logic.

When you share, you create a Permit that:
- Specifies what the recipient can do (read, write, append)
- Contains facts that applications read to determine behavior
- Works as a bearer token (possession proves authorization)
- Requires no permission server for validation

Smart contracts for permissions - decentralized, cryptographic, programmable authorization.

### Data-Driven Configuration

Extended Web applications read their behavior from configurations:

**HUML Templates** - Declarative configurations defining:
- How content renders
- Document names (custom, not hardcoded)
- View behavior
- User controls

**Permit Facts** - Authorization data specifying:
- Which documents this Permit grants access to
- Permissions the holder has
- Sync behavior to apply
- Enabled capabilities

**CEL Expressions** - Safe, sandboxed expressions for:
- Reactive state updates
- Conditional rendering
- Data transformations
- Control flow logic

Applications interpret these configurations at runtime. Customize behavior by editing templates, not rewriting code.

### CRDTs and Static Assets

The Extended Web handles both **CRDTs** (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types) and **static assets**:

**CRDT Documents** - Real-time collaborative documents using Loro:
- Text, lists, maps - automatically merge changes
- Bidirectional sync for collaboration
- Pull-only or push-only patterns for publishing/submissions

**Static Assets** - Media files, images, videos, documents:
- **Read-only static assets** - Videos hosted for viewers, images, files
- **Collaborative static assets** - Comments attached to static content
- Combined patterns - Static video with collaborative comments document

Static assets can be served with CRDT documents (like comments) to create rich interactive experiences.

## Architecture Layers

The Extended Web stack consists of several layers:

### Identity Layer

**PGP certificates with Ed25519 keys** provide identity and encryption:

- **PGP certificate** - Your main identity (Ed25519 internally), used for encryption/decryption, never leaves your device
- **Permit signing keys** - Ed25519 keys derived from PGP using Argon2, converted to DIDs, sign Permits
- **Device keys** - Ed25519 keys for Iroh P2P network layer, establishing connections

These work together for encryption, authorization, and connectivity.

See [Identity & Key Systems](/core/identity) for details.

### Network Layer

Peer-to-peer connectivity through Iroh:

- **QUIC protocol** - Reliable, encrypted transport
- **NAT traversal** - Works through firewalls and routers
- **DHT discovery** - Find peers without centralized directories
- **Connection strings** - Contain pub keys, username, Permit, node address

Peer discovery happens through out-of-band exchange (QR codes, text, email) of connection strings containing everything needed to connect.

See [Peer Discovery](/core/peer-discovery) for details.

### Authorization Layer

Permits provide decentralized access control:

- **Extension of UCAN** - Adds embedded logic, origin tracking, facts-only design
- **Bearer tokens** - Possession proves authorization
- **Document-level permissions** - Viewer, submitter, collaborator roles
- **No permission server** - Cryptographic validation only

Applications read Permit facts to determine allowed operations.

See [Permits](/core/permits) for details.

### Data Layer

Loro CRDTs handle conflict-free synchronization:

- **Automatic merging** - Changes from multiple people merge conflict-free
- **Eventually consistent** - All participants converge to identical state
- **Offline-capable** - Works without connectivity, syncs when reconnected
- **Efficient** - State vector exchange transmits only missing diffs

Sync behavior driven by Permit facts - applications read permissions to determine filtering and merge logic.

See [Synchronization Protocol](/core/sync) for details.

### Application Layer

HUML templates and CEL expressions define behavior:

- **Declarative templates** - Human-readable layouts and configurations
- **Custom documents** - Define your own document names and schemas
- **Data-driven logic** - Merge behavior reads from Permits
- **WebAssembly compilation** - OCaml transpiler produces high-performance WASM (40x faster than JavaScript)

Makes applications flexible, customizable, and user-controllable.

## Personal Node: Essential Infrastructure

**You need at least one personal node** for flawless operation.

**What node does** using Osvauld protocol:
- Merges CRDT operations
- Sends resource updates to users
- Caches updates from users when offline
- Distributes content between all users
- Coordinates synchronization

**Personal node capabilities**:
- Handles CRDT operations and encryption
- Supports multiple concurrent connections
- Future AI capabilities
- Affordable personal infrastructure
- Low power, always-on operation

You control the hardware, software, and network.

See [Setting Up Personal Nodes](/sovereign-node/setting-up) for installation.

## Why This Architecture

This architecture makes sovereignty possible.

When applications run on your devices, data lives with you, and authorization comes from cryptography you control - you own your identity, data, and relationships.

**No dependence on**:
- Platforms staying online
- Companies staying solvent
- Services staying willing to serve you

You hold the keys. You control everything.

That's the Extended Web.
