title: "The Extended Web"
description: "Build interactive applications that are uniquely yours"

At its core, the internet is about reading verified information, collaborating with others, chatting, exchanging files, ordering services, hosting offerings, discussing ideas.

Today, intermediaries control these activities - their algorithms, their feeds, their rules, their infrastructure.

The Extended Web extends the internet so you control these activities. Applications live on your devices, sync through your node. Your cryptography defines permissions. Your designs determine the experience. Same fundamentals, extended to give you sovereignty over your digital life.

## What Makes This Different

**Your infrastructure.** Run an always-on device as your personal node. When you share something, people connect to your node. It handles distribution, caching, and coordination. Your hardware. Your control.

**Your rules.** Create permissions through cryptographic tokens. Define who can access what, how they can interact, what they can see. No permission servers. No accounts. Just cryptography.

**Your designs.** How your application looks and feels is decided by you. Every application you create can be uniquely YOU. Everything is pull, push, or collaborate. Read content. Submit forms. Edit together. These three patterns, customized infinitely, create any application you can imagine.

**Your ownership.** Built on open protocols. Anyone can build on it. Anyone can implement it. It's yours to use, extend, and build on.

**Human-scale applications.** This is for applications where personal control and sovereignty matter - your blog, your storefront, your forms, your messaging, your collaborations.

Share what you build any way you want: send to friends, post on social media, publish to the world. It runs through your node, works on their devices, syncs when connected. No platform controls it. No one can take it down.

## Infinitely Customizable

**The applications you develop are up to your imagination.** Describe what you want in natural language, AI generates the template, and you have full control over how it looks and behaves.

Want a message sent or received to appear as something tumbling down the screen? You can do that. Want to reveal content only after users complete a challenge? You can do that. Want custom animations, colors, and interactions that no one else has? You can do that.

**It's very simple to build.** No programming required - just describe it, and AI handles the rest.

**Every application has unique personality.** No two are the same.

Build:
- Blog or Twitter-like micro blogging with your own layout
- Password manager with your own selective sharing rules
- Survey that reveals results only after you participate
- Messaging with custom colors and UI you define
- Forms that trigger specific actions on submission
- Multiplayer games with live leaderboards
- Real-time applications with your own rules

**Infinite combinations.** Describe what you want, AI creates it, plug and play.

## Freedom by Design

**No ongoing costs.** No monthly server bills. No database licensing. No bandwidth charges. Applications are free by design.

**No platform dependencies.** Applications work offline. Internet enables sharing, not basic functionality. No platform can take it down.

**No surveillance.** Connect directly with collaborators. No platform sees your content. No behavior tracking. No advertising algorithms.

**No intermediaries.** When you share with someone, you're talking directly to their device. Trust is cryptographic, not corporate.

## For Everyone

**Technical people**: Build your own implementation of the Osvauld protocol. Extend it. Hack it. Contribute. It's open source (MIT licensed).

**Everyday people**: Use AI to generate templates. Describe what you want → AI creates it → Use it immediately. Make your own "apps" - it's not hard.

## What You Get

Complete sovereignty over your data, identity, and relationships. Total customization of colors, fonts, layouts, and behaviors. Direct peer-to-peer collaboration without shared infrastructure. End-to-end encryption with no one else processing your content. Applications that work offline. Open source code that anyone can audit. Complete control over your digital identity. Direct relationships without intermediaries. Applications that work for you. The ability to collaborate while maintaining independence. Freedom from platform dependencies. Creative expression without limits.

**Sthalam** is one implementation of the Osvauld protocol - a runtime where Extended Web applications execute. Supports blogs, messaging, password management, forms, surveys, games.

**Build on the Osvauld protocol. The Extended Web is yours.**
