title: "The Extended Web"
description: "Build interactive applications that are uniquely yours"

At its core, the internet is about reading verified information, collaborating with others, chatting, exchanging files, ordering services, hosting offerings, discussing ideas.

Today, intermediaries control these activities - their algorithms, their feeds, their rules, their infrastructure.

The Extended Web extends the internet so you control these activities. Applications live on your devices, sync through your node. Your cryptography defines permissions. Your designs determine the experience. Same fundamentals, extended to give you sovereignty over your digital life.

## What Makes This Different

**Your infrastructure.** Run an always-on device as your personal node. When you share something, people connect to your node. It handles distribution, caching, and coordination. Your hardware. Your control.

**Your rules.** Create permissions through cryptographic tokens. Define who can access what, how they can interact, what they can see. No permission servers. No accounts. Just cryptography.

**Your designs.** Everything is pull, push, or collaborate. Read content. Submit forms. Edit together. These three patterns, customized infinitely, create any application you can imagine.

**Your ownership.** Built on open protocols. Anyone can build on it. Anyone can implement it. It's yours to use, extend, and build on.

Share what you build any way you want: send to friends, post on social media, publish to the world. It runs through your node, works on their devices, syncs when connected. No platform controls it. No one can take it down.

## Infinitely Customizable

Build a **DX Ball game that reveals your blog post** when you complete it. Track highest scores across all readers. Unlock special content based on achievements.

**Every application has unique personality.** No two are the same.

Build:
- Blog or Twitter-like micro blogging with your own layout
- Password manager with your own selective sharing rules
- Survey that reveals results only after you participate
- Messaging with custom colors and UI you define
- Forms that trigger specific actions on submission
- Multiplayer games with live leaderboards
- Real-time applications with your own rules

**Infinite combinations.** AI can generate templates for you - describe what you want, AI creates it, plug and play.

## Freedom by Design

**No ongoing costs.** No monthly server bills. No database licensing. No bandwidth charges. Applications are free by design.

**No platform dependencies.** Applications work offline. Internet enables sharing, not basic functionality. No platform can take it down.

**No surveillance.** Connect directly with collaborators. No platform sees your content. No behavior tracking. No advertising algorithms.

**No intermediaries.** When you share with someone, you're talking directly to their device. Trust is cryptographic, not corporate.

## For Everyone

**Technical people**: Build your own implementation of the Osvauld protocol. Extend it. Hack it. Contribute. It's open source (MIT licensed).

**Everyday people**: Use AI to generate templates. Describe what you want → AI creates it → Use it immediately. Make your own "apps" - it's not hard.

## What You Get

**Complete sovereignty**: Own your data, identity, and relationships. Control everything.

**Total customization**: Define exact colors, fonts, layouts, behaviors. Make it yours.

**Direct collaboration**: Connect peer-to-peer with people you choose. No shared infrastructure.

**Privacy by default**: End-to-end encrypted. Encrypted at rest. No one else processes your content.

**Works offline**: Internet enables sharing, not basic functionality. Always available.

**Open and auditable**: Everything is open source. See exactly how it works.

## Built for Sovereignty

The Extended Web is designed for individuals who want:

- Complete control over digital identity
- Direct relationships without intermediaries
- Applications that work for them
- Ability to collaborate while maintaining independence
- Freedom from platform dependencies
- Creative expression without limits

**Sthalam** is one implementation of the Osvauld protocol - a runtime where Extended Web applications execute. Supports blogs, messaging, password management, forms, surveys, games.

## The Vision

Blockchain integration will enable global discovery while preserving privacy. Find people and resources without centralized directories. Cryptographic proof of ownership. Transparent permission chains. Your identity and ownership records on-chain, your content stays local and encrypted.

**Build on the Osvauld protocol. The Extended Web is yours.**
