> **Exploratory Concepts**: The following describes potential future directions for Sthalam. None of this is currently implemented or planned in detail. These represent aspirational thinking about possibilities.

## Interactive Applications with JEXL

**JEXL (JavaScript Expression Language)** could enable sovereign individuals to build interactive applications with custom logic—without writing code or relying on platforms.

Publishers could define business rules using simple expressions:

```jexl
total = (quantity * price) * (1 - discount) + shipping + tax
showShipping = productType == "physical"
eligible = age >= 18 && hasConsent
```

This would open up **more interactive sovereign applications** beyond static publishing:

- E-commerce stores with custom pricing and checkout logic
- Restaurant ordering with menu customization
- Service marketplaces with availability management
- Booking systems with flexible policies

All customizable to each sovereign individual's unique business rules—without platform constraints.

## Human-Readable Names via Blockchain

Currently, sharing content requires base64-encoded connection strings (large text blobs). Blockchain could enable **human-readable names** similar to ENS.

**Identity-Based Addressing**:
- **Pinning uses ECC keys** (elliptic curve cryptography), not content hashes
- ECC keys **always resolve to node identity**—stable addressing regardless of content changes
- **Blockchain stores addressing information**: Node location + optional description
- **Publishing generates transactions** on blockchain with your node's addressing info

**How it works**:
- Register names like `@alice` or `myblog.sthalam` that map to your node identity (ECC keys)
- **Cheap resolution**: Read blockchain once for initial discovery, then store locally
- **Blockchain agnostic**: Works with different blockchains—you choose which one(s) to use
- **Multiple accounts**: Users can have multiple names registered across different blockchains
- **Indexing for discovery**: Public indexers can crawl blockchain records for search results

**Benefits**:
- Simple sharing (type `@alice` instead of pasting a large connection string)
- Content discovery via public search (indexers read blockchain, provide search interface)
- Multi-device updates (change nodes, update blockchain once—everyone resolves new location)
- **Minimal blockchain dependency**: Only read once for discovery, then everything cached locally
- **Identity-based, not content-based**: ECC keys point to your node identity, not individual content hashes

The architecture supports both direct connection string sharing and blockchain-based naming. Blockchain adds a powerful naming and discovery layer, enabling human-readable addresses and public search while maintaining the core P2P infrastructure.

## IPFS Integration

The architecture supports **IPFS integration** for offloading static content distribution. The **data layer and static layer are architecturally separate**, enabling flexible deployment strategies.

**What stays in pure P2P**:
- Data layer: CRDT operations, real-time sync
- Comments and form submissions
- All interactive features
- Collaborative editing in Livnote
- Conversations in Libremot

**What can optionally use IPFS**:
- **Only static website content** (HTML, CSS, images for Sthalam websites)
- This offloads hosting burden from your sovereign node
- **Content is encrypted before pinning**—safe to use public IPFS infrastructure
- Even if others pin your content, they only store encrypted blobs

**Why this helps**:
- **Reduces load on your sovereign node**: Static content served from IPFS instead of your home hardware
- **Bandwidth savings**: Large website assets don't consume your home internet bandwidth
- **Flexible offloading**: Use IPFS when you need to reduce strain on your node
- **Data layer stays P2P**: All interactive features (comments, forms, CRDT sync) remain pure peer-to-peer

The core apps (Sthalam, Livnote, Libremot) are designed to work entirely in pure P2P, with IPFS integration available when you need distributed content delivery.

## Interactive Bidirectional Workflows

The current model uses append-only submissions to publisher-owned documents. An interesting direction would be **viewer-owned submission documents** where:

- Viewers create and own their submissions
- Publishers receive delegated access to read and update
- Updates flow bidirectionally
- Viewers can delete their data anytime—deletion propagates to publisher

**Privacy by Default**:
- **Viewer identities are NOT stored in nodes** (turned off by default)
- **One-way connection**: Viewers can connect to nodes, but nodes CANNOT connect to viewers
- **Protocol respects UCAN tokens**: All access controlled by cryptographic permissions
- **Data deletion**: When viewers delete their data, it's deleted from publisher's side too
- **Offline data caveat**: Local copies may exist on devices before deletion—standard limitation of distributed systems

**Single Identity Across All Interactions**:
- **No login required**: Your self-sovereign identity works across all websites, e-commerce, service sites
- **Same protocol everywhere**: Browse content, place orders, book services—all using the same cryptographic identity
- **No usernames or passwords**: Your identity authenticates you automatically via UCAN tokens
- **No repeated signups**: Never create accounts again—your identity works with any sovereign website or service

This could enable sovereign alternatives to centralized platforms:

- **E-commerce**: Viewers place orders they own, publishers update status, viewers can cancel
- **Restaurant ordering**: Viewers control orders, restaurants update status (preparing → ready)
- **Service marketplaces**: Viewers create requests, providers respond, back-and-forth negotiation
- **Booking systems**: Viewers own bookings, providers manage availability

All without platform intermediaries or transaction fees. **Viewers maintain sovereignty over their identity and data**—publishers never get the ability to initiate contact or store viewer identities.

## LLM Integration

The Osvauld ecosystem is designed for **collaborative editing, spreadsheets, conversations, and content creation**. The architecture supports **LLM integration** to enhance these collaborative workflows.

**Node-Hosted LLMs**: Run language models on your sovereign node hardware
- **Hardware Options**: Boards like Radxa Orion 6 with built-in NPUs (45 TOPS) for AI inference
- **Local Processing**: NPUs with 45 TOPS enable efficient on-device inference—LLM assistance happens on your own infrastructure
- **No External Dependencies**: No need for ChatGPT, Claude, or other third-party AI services
- **Privacy by Design**: LLM interactions never leave your sovereign node
- **Multimodal Capability**: Process text, images, audio, and structured data locally
- **Efficient Context Management**: CRDTs enable surgical updates—send only changed parts of conversations instead of entire context, making LLM context efficient
- **LLMs Have Identities**: LLMs get their own cryptographic identities (DIDs), just like humans—you delegate UCAN tokens to LLM identities to grant specific permissions
- **Fine-Grained Permissions**: The data model already supports document-type-based permissions in UCANs—making it easy to grant LLM identities access to specific documents while denying access to others, or even restricting access to parts of documents

### How LLMs Can Help with CRDTs

The core collaborative features (editing, sheets, conversations) use CRDTs for conflict-free synchronization. **LLMs can assist** with these activities:

- **Suggesting edits**: LLM suggestions appear as CRDT operations, merging with human edits without conflicts
- **Drafting content**: LLMs can help draft sections while you continue editing elsewhere
- **Formatting & cleanup**: LLMs can reorganize or improve clarity without disrupting collaboration
- **Summarizing discussions**: In Libremot conversations, LLMs can extract key points
- **Spreadsheet formulas**: Help generate or debug formulas in collaborative sheets
- **Fine-grained control**: UCAN permissions based on document types make it easy to grant LLMs access to some documents while denying access to others—or even restricting access to specific parts of documents

### LLMs Helping Across Sovereign Nodes

When multiple people collaborate (on documents, sheets, conversations), their LLMs can optionally help too—simple to implement because of CRDT operations and **function calling**.

**Function Calling for LLM Assistance**:

LLMs support **function calling**—they can invoke specific functions to help with collaborative work. Each LLM has its own cryptographic identity (DID), and you delegate UCAN tokens to that identity:

- **Read documents** from Livnote (if granted UCAN read permissions to the LLM's identity)
- **Suggest edits** via CRDT operations (if granted write permissions)
- **Retrieve conversation history** from Libremot to provide context
- **Fetch files** needed for tasks (with correct UCAN permissions)
- **Check permissions** before taking actions
- **Access spreadsheets** to help with formulas or data analysis
- **You control everything**: Delegate UCAN tokens to LLM identities to grant specific permissions—just like you would with human collaborators

**Practical Help for Collaborative Work**:

**Document Editing**:
- Team collaborates on Livnote documents
- LLMs can suggest improvements, fix formatting, or help draft sections
- All changes merge via CRDTs—no conflicts
- You control which documents your LLM can access

**Spreadsheet Work**:
- Collaborative spreadsheets
- LLMs help generate formulas, analyze data, or spot errors
- Each person's LLM only accesses what they're granted permission for

**Conversation Assistance**:
- Long Libremot discussion threads
- LLMs can retrieve conversation history and extract key points or action items
- Helps teams stay organized

**Translation**:
- Multilingual collaboration
- LLMs translate messages or documents locally (no external APIs)
- Privacy preserved—happens on your sovereign node

**LLM integration benefits**: The architecture's support for function calling + CRDT operations makes LLM integration straightforward for collaborative features (editing, sheets, conversations). **You decide which content each LLM can access** via UCAN permissions.

### Sthalam: Template Generation with LLMs

**Current Implementation**:
Sthalam already supports LLM-powered template generation. Users upload the `HUML_TEMPLATE_GUIDE.md` (specifically designed for LLMs) to external services like ChatGPT or Claude, describe what they want to build, and the LLM generates HUML template code.

**Future: Local Template Generation**:
- **Node-hosted LLMs**: Generate templates locally on your sovereign node instead of using external services
- **Privacy-preserving**: Template generation conversations never leave your infrastructure
- **Iterative refinement**: "Add a contact form," "change the layout," "make it responsive"—all local
- **No API costs**: Generate unlimited templates without external service fees

### Livnote: LLM-Assisted Collaborative Editing

**Smart Document Collaboration**:
- **Real-Time Suggestions**: LLM reads collaborative documents and offers suggestions as CRDT operations
- **Context-Aware Writing**: LLM sees all collaborators' edits and maintains document coherence
- **Research Integration**: Ask questions about the document—LLM provides inline answers
- **Formatting & Structure**: LLM reorganizes sections, fixes formatting, improves clarity
- **Knowledge Synthesis**: Multiple people brainstorm—LLM synthesizes ideas into coherent text

**Visual Intelligence**:
- **Image Understanding**: Paste images—LLM describes, extracts text, suggests captions
- **Diagram Generation**: Describe a concept—LLM creates mermaid diagrams or structured layouts
- **Document Summarization**: LLM generates summaries as you collaboratively edit

### Libremot: LLM-Enhanced Communication

**Conversational Intelligence**:
- **Smart Replies**: LLM suggests context-aware responses in chat threads
- **Language Translation**: Real-time translation in peer-to-peer conversations—all local
- **Voice Transcription**: Multimodal LLM transcribes voice messages with speaker identification
- **Meeting Summaries**: LLM generates summaries from chat history or call transcripts

**Context-Aware Assistance**:
- **File Understanding**: Share documents—LLM answers questions about attachments
- **Thread Synthesis**: Long conversations—LLM extracts action items and decisions
- **Smart Search**: Semantic search across message history without external indexing

### Cross-App LLM Workflows

**Unified Intelligence Across Apps**:
- **Shared Context**: LLM maintains awareness across Sthalam, Livnote, and Libremot
- **Workflow Automation**: "Write a blog post about this chat conversation" → LLM creates HUML template
- **Content Repurposing**: Chat discussions → collaborative documents → published articles
- **Semantic Connections**: LLM suggests related content across apps ("this chat relates to your blog post...")

**CRDT-Powered Collaboration**:
- **Human + LLM Co-Editing**: Both edit simultaneously—no turn-taking, no conflicts
- **Streaming Intelligence**: LLM suggestions appear incrementally as CRDT updates
- **Reversible AI**: Every LLM change tracked as CRDT operations—full undo/redo
- **Multi-LLM Collaboration**: Different LLMs contribute different perspectives in parallel

### Why Node-Hosted Multimodal LLMs Matter

**True Sovereignty**:
- AI capabilities run on hardware you physically control
- No dependency on external API providers
- Your conversations and data never leave your infrastructure

**Privacy Preservation**:
- Images, documents, voice—all processed locally
- No data harvesting by AI companies
- Multimodal processing without surveillance

**Offline Capability**:
- Full LLM functionality without internet connectivity
- Process sensitive data without cloud access

**Cost Control**:
- No API fees or usage limits
- Unlimited multimodal processing on your hardware

**Personalization**:
- LLM learns your writing style, preferences, terminology
- Adapts to your workflows across all apps

The combination of **CRDTs for synchronization**, **peer-to-peer architecture for distribution**, and **node-hosted multimodal LLMs for intelligence** creates an ecosystem where humans and AI collaborate seamlessly across publishing, editing, and communication—all on sovereign infrastructure without platform dependencies.

## The Super App: An Alternative Internet Experience

**Sthalam** is one piece of a larger vision—a complete sovereign ecosystem that reimagines how we interact with the digital world. By combining multiple peer-to-peer applications sharing the same cryptographic foundation, we're building an **alternative way to browse and experience the internet**.

### The Unified Vision

All Osvauld applications share the same underlying infrastructure:

- **Self-Sovereign Identity**: One cryptographic identity (PGP keys, Ed25519, UCAN) across all apps
- **CRDT Synchronization**: Real-time collaboration without conflicts
- **Peer-to-Peer Architecture**: Direct connections without intermediaries
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Complete privacy by design
- **Sovereign Nodes**: Your own infrastructure for hosting and distribution

This shared foundation enables seamless integration between:

#### Sthalam (Publishing)
Create and distribute websites, blogs, newsletters, forms, and surveys. Publish content to the world or specific viewers—all on your terms.

#### Livnote (Collaborative Editor)
Real-time collaborative document editing with peers. Work together on notes, documents, and projects with cryptographic ownership and CRDT-based synchronization.

#### Libremot (Chat & Messaging)
Peer-to-peer messaging and calls without accounts or platform lock-in. Your conversations exist only between you and your peers—no servers, no surveillance.

#### File Transfer
Direct peer-to-peer file sharing and backup without third-party clouds. Share files of any size directly with peers, or backup to your sovereign node.

### Browsing a Sovereign Internet

Instead of opening a web browser that connects you to centralized platforms, imagine an application where:

**Discovery Without Platforms**: Browse content shared by peers through cryptographic connections, not algorithms. Search and discover publishers without intermediaries indexing your behavior.

**Unified Identity**: One self-sovereign identity works across all interactions—reading blogs, editing documents, chatting with peers, sharing files. No separate accounts, no password managers, no identity fragmentation.

**Context-Aware Interactions**: Reading a blog post on Sthalam? Start a chat with the author via Libremot. Collaborating on a document in Livnote? Share reference files via file transfer. All seamlessly integrated.

**Offline-First by Design**: Content syncs to your device and works without connectivity. Read saved blogs, edit documents, queue messages—everything functions locally first, syncing when connected.

**Privacy as Default**: No tracking pixels, no analytics harvesting your behavior, no third-party scripts. Publishers can't see more than you explicitly allow, and viewers browse without surveillance.

### The Architecture Advantage

Because all applications share the same cryptographic primitives and peer-to-peer infrastructure:

**Single Node, Multiple Apps**: Your sovereign node hosts your websites (Sthalam), collaborative documents (Livnote), message history (Libremot), and shared files—all from one piece of infrastructure.

**Unified Permissions**: UCAN-based authorization works across apps. Grant someone permission to view your blog, edit your documents, and chat with you—using the same token system.

**Cross-App Workflows**: Publish a blog post (Sthalam) with embedded collaborative sections (Livnote) and a contact form that sends messages (Libremot) with file attachments (File Transfer)—all sovereign, all peer-to-peer.

**Interoperable Data**: CRDTs enable real-time synchronization across all apps. Updates flow seamlessly whether you're editing documents, posting comments, or sending messages.

### Taking It Home

This is about more than just privacy or decentralization—it's about **sovereignty over your digital life**:

**Core Infrastructure**:
- Your content lives on hardware you physically control
- Your relationships exist through direct cryptographic connections
- Your data never touches servers you don't own
- **One identity for everything**: Never login to websites, e-commerce, or services again—your self-sovereign identity works everywhere, same protocol
- Your identity isn't tied to any platform or company
- Pure peer-to-peer for all interactive features (CRDT sync, comments, forms, conversations)

**Extended Capabilities** (all running on your sovereign node):
- **IPFS Integration**: Offload static website content to reduce strain on your node—encrypted before pinning, safe to use public infrastructure
- **Blockchain Naming**: Human-readable names (@alice, myblog.sthalam) instead of connection strings for easy discovery
- **Interactive Applications**: JEXL-powered business logic for e-commerce, booking systems, service marketplaces—without platform constraints
- **LLMs**: AI assistants (with their own identities) to help with editing, conversations, spreadsheets—you control access via UCAN permissions
- **Bidirectional Workflows**: Viewer-owned submissions enabling sovereign alternatives to centralized platforms

The "super app" isn't software—it's infrastructure for a sovereign internet where individuals control their digital presence completely. Browse websites, edit documents, chat with friends, share files, run interactive applications—all without surrendering control to platforms.

**This is what taking it home really means**: the internet, but on your terms, running on your hardware, with your rules. Core features work entirely peer-to-peer, with extended capabilities you can enable when needed—all sovereign, all under your control.

## Why These Matter

These concepts would transform Osvauld from a collection of applications into **infrastructure for a sovereign internet**—enabling individuals to publish, collaborate, communicate, and transact on their own terms, with their own logic, without centralized platforms.
