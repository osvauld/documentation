> **Future Directions**: The following describes potential enhancements to the Osvauld ecosystem. These represent capabilities the architecture can support.

## Commerce

The architecture can support **commerce applications**—small e-commerce sites, service listings, and interactive transactions—powered by **JEXL (JavaScript Expression Language)** for business logic.

**What can be done**:
- **Small e-commerce sites**: Sell products directly from your sovereign node
- **Service listings**: List services (consulting, freelancing, bookings) without platform fees
- **Custom business logic**: Define pricing, discounts, shipping rules using JEXL expressions
- **Interactive applications**: Restaurant ordering, booking systems, marketplace transactions

**How JEXL helps**:

Simple expressions define business rules without complex code:

```jexl
total = (quantity * price) * (1 - discount) + shipping + tax
showShipping = productType == "physical"
eligible = age >= 18 && hasConsent
```

**How blockchain helps**:
- **Publishing**: Blockchain enables content and service discovery
- **Listings**: Users list their services on blockchain for public discovery
- **No platform dependency**: Direct commerce between sovereign individuals

Commerce happens peer-to-peer, with blockchain providing the discovery layer.

## Discovery

Currently, sharing content requires base64-encoded connection strings. Blockchain enables **human-readable names and public discovery**.

**How it works**:
- Register names like `@alice` or `myblog.sthalam` on blockchain
- **Blockchain identity is a deterministic derivative** of your main identity key—not a separate key
- Names map to your node identity using **ECC keys** (elliptic curve cryptography)
- ECC keys always resolve to your node identity—stable addressing
- Publishing generates blockchain transactions with your node's addressing info

**What this enables**:
- **Human-readable sharing**: Type `@alice` instead of pasting connection strings
- **Public discovery**: Indexers crawl blockchain records, provide search results
- **Service listings**: Find e-commerce sites, service providers, content publishers
- **Multi-device updates**: Change nodes, update blockchain once—everyone resolves new location

**Efficient design**:
- Read blockchain once for initial discovery, then cache locally
- Blockchain agnostic—works with different blockchains
- Users can have multiple names across different blockchains
- Identity-based addressing (ECC keys), not content-based (hashes)

Blockchain provides the discovery layer. Once discovered, all interactions happen peer-to-peer.

## IPFS Integration

IPFS integration enables **offloading static content** to reduce strain on sovereign nodes. The data layer and static layer are architecturally separate.

**What uses IPFS**:
- Static website content (HTML, CSS, images)
- **Content encrypted before pinning**—safe to use public IPFS infrastructure
- Others can pin your content, but they only store encrypted blobs

**What stays P2P**:
- Data layer: CRDT operations, real-time sync
- Comments, forms, conversations
- All interactive features

**Why this helps**:
- Reduces load on your sovereign node
- Bandwidth savings for large website assets
- Distributed availability while maintaining privacy

IPFS is for static content distribution. All interactive features remain pure peer-to-peer.

## LLM Integration

The architecture supports **running LLMs on your sovereign node** to assist with collaborative editing, spreadsheets, and conversations.

**Node-hosted LLMs**:
- Hardware: Boards like Radxa Orion 6 with NPUs (45 TOPS) for AI inference
- Local processing: LLM assistance happens on your own infrastructure
- Privacy: LLM interactions never leave your sovereign node
- Multimodal: Process text, images, audio, and structured data locally

**Efficient design**:
- **CRDT surgical updates**: Send only changed parts of conversations, not entire context
- **LLMs have identities**: Each LLM gets its own DID—delegate UCAN tokens for permissions
- **Fine-grained control**: Grant LLMs access to specific documents or parts of documents

**What LLMs can help with**:
- Document editing: Suggest edits, draft content, fix formatting
- Spreadsheets: Generate formulas, analyze data
- Conversations: Summarize discussions, translate messages
- Templates: Generate HUML templates locally (Sthalam currently uses external LLM services)

## Node-to-Node Syncing

Sovereign nodes can act as intermediaries, retrieving content on behalf of users. Instead of viewers connecting directly to publishers, their nodes connect and sync content for them.

**How it works**:
- Your sovereign node connects to publisher's node on your behalf
- Node retrieves content and syncs it locally
- You access content from your own node later
- No need for direct connections from your desktop

**What this enables**:
- **Asynchronous access**: Retrieve content when publisher's node is online, access it anytime from your node
- **File syncing**: Your node downloads files in the background, you access them locally
- **Offline reading**: Content synced to your node remains available when publisher goes offline
- **Bandwidth efficiency**: Your node handles the connection, multiple devices access from your local node
- **Local speed**: Access content at local network speeds—up to 3 Gbps, not limited by internet bandwidth

**Use cases**:
- File sharing: Large files sync to your node, access from any device
- Content subscription: Your node periodically syncs updates from publishers you follow
- Group collaboration: Nodes sync documents, ensuring availability when peers go offline

**Proactive downloads**:
- Visitors with their own nodes get automatic background downloads
- No need to have the app switched on—your node handles syncing while you're away
- Large files sync easily in the background without keeping the app open
- Content ready when you open the app

**Architecture benefits**:
- **Cheap storage**: Sovereign nodes provide affordable local storage for synced content
- **High interactivity**: Offline-first design means instant access without waiting for network requests
- **High availability**: Node-to-node communication makes the system highly available—content remains accessible even when individual publishers go offline
- **Super fast access**: Accessing content from your node is extremely fast because it's local network access—high throughput with newer hardware
- **Always available**: Content on your node works regardless of publisher connectivity

Node-to-node syncing separates content retrieval from content access—your node does the work of staying connected while you access content on your own schedule.

## Verifiability with Digital Signatures

Content can be cryptographically signed, with blockchain records providing verifiable origin. Nobody can impersonate you.

**How it works**:
- Publishers sign content with their identity keys
- Blockchain records the original publisher with their signature
- Content stays offline (P2P), but origin is verifiable through blockchain
- Signatures prevent impersonation—you can't fake being the original publisher

**What this enables**:
- **Verifiable origin**: Cryptographic proof of who originally published content
- **Tamper detection**: Any modification breaks the signature, proving content was altered
- **Impersonation prevention**: Signatures prove authenticity—nobody can fake your identity
- **Attribution**: Clear proof of original creator, even when content is shared

**Use cases**:
- News and journalism: Verify article origins through blockchain records
- Research and citations: Cryptographic proof of original authorship
- Content sharing: Share with verifiable attribution to original creator
- Misinformation prevention: Detect when content has been altered or falsely attributed

Blockchain provides the verification layer while content stays P2P—you can always verify origin without compromising the offline-first architecture.

## Conclusion

These capabilities—**commerce, discovery, IPFS, LLMs, node-to-node syncing, and verifiable digital signatures**—extend the core peer-to-peer infrastructure.

The architecture is designed to support these enhancements while maintaining the fundamental principles: sovereignty, privacy, and direct peer-to-peer collaboration. Each capability can be integrated as needed, with the core apps (Sthalam, Livnote, Libremot) continuing to work entirely peer-to-peer.
