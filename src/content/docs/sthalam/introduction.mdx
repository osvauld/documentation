description: "Runtime for Extended Web applications on the Osvauld protocol"
---

> **POC Status**: Sthalam is currently a proof-of-concept demonstrating the Osvauld protocol. The architecture and cryptographic foundation are in place. See the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/osvauld/osvauld) for source code (MIT licensed).

## TL;DR

**Sthalam** (സ്ഥലം - meaning "place" in Malayalam) is a runtime for Extended Web applications on the Osvauld protocol.

- **Applications run on your devices** - not in data centers
- **Data lives with you** - not on company servers
- **Peer-to-peer connections** - no intermediaries
- **Cryptographic authorization** - Permits instead of platform permissions
- **Three merge patterns**: Pull-only (read), Push-only (submit), Bidirectional (collaborate)
- **Build anything**: Blogs, messaging, forms, surveys, password management, games
- **AI-generated templates** - no coding required
- **Personal node** - Always-on infrastructure for sync

## What is Sthalam?

Sthalam is one implementation of the Osvauld protocol - a runtime where Extended Web applications execute.

There is no backend - all application logic is embedded in HUML templates (rendering logic) and Permits (merge logic). Permits are derivative of HUML. The Osvauld protocol executes this embedded logic. Everything works offline by default, syncing when connected through peer-to-peer connections. You control your data, your identity, and who you collaborate with.

**You choose public or private**:
- **Public**: Blogs, newsletters, websites, public chat, public discussions - share openly with your audience
- **Private**: Private messaging, password management, private forms, private surveys - selective access only

All applications can be either public or private based on your choice.

**Infinitely Customizable**: Create any interface using HUML templates (declarative configurations). Define custom permissions with Permit facts. Sthalam reads templates and Permits to determine application behavior.

## Personal Node

A **personal node** is essential - you need at least one node for flawless operation. Your always-on device handles distribution, buffers updates, and coordinates sync. It's an extension of you - you control the hardware, software, and network.

## Fundamental Merge Patterns

All applications are built by combining three patterns:

**1. Pull-Only (Read-Only)**
Publisher updates → viewers receive → viewers cannot send back
*Use for*: Blogs, newsletters, announcements, dashboards

**2. Push-Only (Append-Only)**
Viewers submit → publisher receives → viewers don't see others' submissions
*Use for*: Forms, surveys, feedback collection, polls

**3. Bidirectional (Collaborative)**
All participants edit → Loro CRDT merges → everyone converges
*Use for*: Messaging, password sharing, games

## Infinitely Customizable

**DX Ball game that reveals your blog post** when you complete it:
- Content document: Pull-only (post content locked until game complete)
- Game state document: Bidirectional (track your progress)
- Scores document: Bidirectional (live leaderboard across all readers)
- Unlock logic: CEL expressions check game completion before revealing content

**Every application has unique personality.** Build:
- Password manager with your own selective sharing rules
- Survey that reveals aggregated results only after you participate
- Messaging with custom merge logic you define
- Forms that trigger specific actions on submission
- Multiplayer games with live leaderboards and achievement systems
- Real-time applications with your own conflict resolution rules

Templates define everything: document names, merge behavior, permissions, UI. **Infinite combinations.**

**AI-Generated**: Upload HUML template guide to ChatGPT or Claude, describe what you want (even the DX Ball blog!), AI generates the template. No programming knowledge needed. **Plug and play.**

## Current Status & Future

**Implemented NOW**:
- Permit-based authorization
- Loro CRDT synchronization
- Peer-to-peer connections (Iroh)
- Document-level permissions
- Desktop application (Tauri + WASM)
- Orange Pi 6 Plus node support

**Planned**:
- Blockchain integration (essential for discovery, verifiability, auditability - ERC-5192 identity, ERC-721 resources)
- AI features on Orange Pi NPU
- Mobile applications
- Enhanced template library

## Getting Started

Sthalam is currently a POC. To explore:

1. **Review Architecture**: See the Architecture section for identity, Permits, and sync details
2. **See Examples**: Check Examples section for sample applications
3. **Explore Code**: [GitHub repository](https://github.com/osvauld/osvauld)

Production setup will include:
- Generate cryptographic identity (PGP and Permit signing keys)
- Set up personal node (Orange Pi 6 Plus or existing hardware)
- Install Sthalam desktop application

## The Vision

Sthalam demonstrates the Osvauld protocol in action - a runtime where individuals control their digital lives without depending on platforms.

The Extended Web enables:
- **Personal sovereignty**: Complete control over identity, data, relationships
- **Infinite customization**: Data-driven applications via templates
- **Seamless experience**: Identity built into protocol, background sync
- **Affordable uniqueness**: AI-generated apps without coding
- **Future-ready**: Blockchain integration for verifiability while preserving privacy

**This is your sovereign place on the internet.**
