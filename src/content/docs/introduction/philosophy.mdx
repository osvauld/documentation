Remember when software just worked?
When you could open Notepad, start typing, and create something meaningful without signing up for accounts,
choosing subscription plans, or wondering where your data would end up?
Osvauld embodies this lost simplicity - it's a return to software that serves you, not the other way around.

We're introducing a fundamentally new paradigm:
**applications that are fully internet-accessible yet completely free from tracking, data collection, and corporate intermediaries**.
No middleman sits between you and your digital life - 
no company analyzing your behavior, no algorithm deciding what you see,
no server storing profiles about who you are.

**Our mission is to make you digitally self-sufficient**.
Whether it's messaging friends, making audio and video calls,
managing your passwords, organizing your todos, working with spreadsheets, 
backing up files, or preserving your precious memories.
you shouldn't need to depend on a dozen different companies,
  each with their own terms of service, privacy policies, and monthly fees.

Osvauld applications connect people directly to each other across the internet,
enabling real-time collaboration and communication without anyone
watching, recording, or monetizing these interactions.
You get all the power of modern connected software - instant sync,
seamless sharing, global accessibility - 
but with the privacy and autonomy that should have been yours all along.

**Everything is open source** - every line of code we write,
every library we depend on, every cryptographic implementation we use. 
There are no black boxes, no proprietary algorithms, no hidden backdoors.
You can inspect, verify, modify, and redistribute everything.
This isn't just transparency; it's accountability built into the very foundation.

This isn't just about privacy;
it's about restoring the internet to its original promise:
a decentralized network where people connect directly,
share freely, and create together without asking permission from gatekeepers.
Every Osvauld application proves that we don't need 
to sacrifice our digital sovereignty for convenience - we can have both.

The future of software is elegantly simple: functional tools without restrictions or tracking,
designed to serve your needs rather than extract your data.
Software that works, connects, and stays out of your way.
