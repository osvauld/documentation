## The Problem

Today, almost everything we do online requires surrendering sovereignty over our digital identity.

- To message friends persistently, you need at least an email account tied to a platform's identity system.
- Your photos and files are accessible only through accounts you must maintain with specific services.
- Even your home devices — cameras, lights, locks — need permission from remote servers to function, despite being physically in your house.

These systems work well functionally, but require you to give up control over your digital identity and relationships:

- **Identity dependence** – Your ability to communicate depends on maintaining accounts with third parties.
- **Permission-based access** – You need ongoing authorization from platforms to use services and access your own devices.
- **No true ownership** – Even with encryption, your digital relationships exist only within systems you don't control.

The result: we've traded digital sovereignty for convenience. For those who want complete control over their digital life, current solutions aren't enough.

## Our Solution: Direct Digital Collaboration

We're building everyday applications that connect people **directly** — without servers, subscriptions, or intermediaries.

- **Messaging & calls** that work peer-to-peer, without accounts or platform lock-in.
- **File sharing & backup** that never touches a third-party cloud.
- **Password and identity management** that lives with you, not in a company's vault.
- **Device access** that doesn't depend on remote servers to function.

With Osvauld apps, you get the convenience of modern connected tools — instant sync, global reach, seamless sharing — but without surrendering your identity, data, or relationships to anyone else.

## Principles We Build On

**Open source by default** – Every line of code is transparent, auditable, and modifiable. No black boxes.

**Free to use** – Peer-to-peer architecture means no server costs, no subscriptions, no hidden fees.

**You own your keys** – Your identity and access are secured by cryptography, not controlled by third parties. Nobody can revoke your permissions but you.

## Building Your Personal Internet

This isn't just about privacy — it's about independence. A digital life where:

- Your conversations and files are always available because they live with you.
- Your devices respond to you, not a distant company's server.
- Collaboration happens directly between people, without gatekeepers.

We believe the internet should have worked this way from the start. That's why we're building it now — one application at a time.

**Join us in creating tools that put you back in control of your digital world.**
