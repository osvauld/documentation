title: "Our Manifesto"
description: "An ecosystem of fully self-sovereign apps"
---


Your digital identity exists only within third-party systems. Your ability to connect, collaborate, and even access things you own depends entirely on external platforms, their business decisions, geopolitical factors, and their continued existence. Your security camera streams route through servers you don't control.

**We're building the basic apps that work without third-party dependencies** - the fundamental digital tools that should have existed from the beginning. Messaging, file sharing, password managers, IoT device access, and direct peer connections that give you full user sovereignty over identity, data, and your own property. Your smart home devices require permission from distant data centers to function. Even with end-to-end encryption, you are not fully self-sovereign when your digital relationships and device access require permission from intermediaries.

## The Dependency Crisis

Every collaborative task now requires navigating dependencies on external platforms:

- **Identity dependence**: Your digital identity exists only within third-party systems
- **Platform lock-in**: Your relationships and data tied to specific services
- **Geopolitical vulnerability**: Access subject to business decisions and regulatory changes
- **Service continuity risk**: Your collaborative relationships depend on companies staying operational
- **Limited sovereignty**: Even with end-to-end encryption, the platform controls access to your connections

The result is that we've lost true collaborative autonomy. What should be direct human cooperation has become mediated by platforms that, regardless of their intentions, maintain control over your digital relationships and collaborative capacity.

## Our Solution: Direct Digital Collaboration

We're introducing a fundamentally new paradigm: **applications that are fully internet-accessible yet completely free from tracking, data collection, and corporate intermediaries**. No middleman sits between you and your digital life - no company analyzing your behavior, no algorithm deciding what you see, no server storing profiles about who you are.

**Our mission is to make you digitally self-sufficient**. Whether it's messaging friends, making audio and video calls, managing your passwords, organizing your projects, backing up files, or preserving your precious memories, you shouldn't need to depend on external platforms for your digital identity or collaborative relationships.

Osvauld applications connect people directly to each other across the internet, enabling real-time collaboration and communication without dependency on third-party services. You get all the power of modern connected software - instant sync, seamless sharing, global accessibility - but with complete sovereignty over your digital identity and relationships.

## Built on Uncompromising Principles

**Everything is open source** - every line of code we write, every library we depend on, every cryptographic implementation we use. There are no black boxes, no proprietary algorithms, no hidden backdoors. You can inspect, verify, modify, and redistribute everything. This isn't just transparency; it's accountability built into the very foundation.

**Absolutely free by design** - no purchase required, no subscriptions, no hidden costs. Since our applications run entirely peer-to-peer, there are no server costs to pass on to users. Free software should actually be free.

**Cryptographically sovereign** - you own your identity, your data, and your relationships. Mathematical proof replaces corporate promises. Your permissions can't be revoked by third parties because they're encoded in cryptographic tokens that only you control.

## Building Your Personal Internet

This isn't just about privacy; it's about creating a personal internet for you and your collaborators: a decentralized network where people connect directly, share freely, and create together without asking permission from gatekeepers. 

Every Osvauld application proves that we don't need to sacrifice our digital sovereignty for convenience - we can have both. The future of software is elegantly simple: functional tools without restrictions or tracking, designed to serve your needs rather than extract your data.

**The technology exists. The time is now.**

We're not waiting for external validation to build the internet we deserve. We're building it ourselves, one sovereign application at a time. Software that works, connects, and maintains your autonomy.

Join us in reclaiming digital collaboration.
