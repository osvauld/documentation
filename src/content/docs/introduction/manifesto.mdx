## Understanding How the Web Works Today

When you use most web applications, they follow a familiar pattern:

- Your data lives on someone else's servers
- You access it through accounts tied to specific platforms
- Applications run in data centers, not on your devices
- Your identity, content, and relationships exist within systems someone else operates

This architecture works well for many purposes and has enabled remarkable innovation. But it has a fundamental characteristic: **your digital life depends on systems you don't control**.

For individuals who want complete sovereignty over their digital identity, data, and relationships, this creates inherent limitations.

## Introducing the Extended Web

The Extended Web is a different paradigm for how applications can work on the internet.

It's not a replacement for the current web or an alternate internet. It runs on the same network infrastructure you use every day. What's different is how applications operate:

### Your Applications Run on Your Devices

Instead of applications running in data centers, Extended Web applications run on your laptop, phone, or tablet. Your data lives with you. Everything works offline by default, syncing when you're connected.

You can use a personal home node - a small computer like the Orange Pi 6 Plus - as an always-on facilitator for store-and-forward messaging, relay services, and hosting content publicly. But it's your device, under your control, not a shared server.

### Connections Are Peer-to-Peer

When you collaborate with others, your devices connect directly - peer to peer. There's no intermediary processing your content or managing permissions.

Your personal node helps facilitate connections (so both people don't need to be online simultaneously), but it's extending you, not acting as a centralized service.

### Authorization Through Cryptography

Instead of asking permission from servers, Extended Web applications use **Permits** - cryptographically signed authorization tokens that work much like smart contracts do for blockchain.

When you share content with someone, you give them a Permit. That Permit:
- Contains all the authorization logic they need (no permission server required)
- Is verified through cryptography (signatures prove it's authentic)
- Works as a bearer token (possession proves authorization)
- Contains facts that applications read to determine behavior

This is decentralized authorization - the same concept as smart contracts, but for personal applications instead of blockchain transactions.

### Applications Are Data-Driven

Extended Web applications read their behavior from declarative templates and Permit facts, rather than having everything hardcoded.

In Sthalam (our publishing platform), you define:
- Document names (custom, not hardcoded)
- How content should merge when edited by multiple people
- What permissions different viewers should have
- How your content should be rendered

All of this is configured through HUML templates - human-readable, shareable configurations that you control.

## What This Means for You

**Local-first** - Your applications work on your devices. You can work offline. Internet connectivity enables sharing, not basic functionality.

**You control your identity** - Your identity is based on cryptographic keys you hold, not accounts on someone else's platform.

**Direct collaboration** - When you work with others, you connect peer-to-peer. No one else processes your content or controls access.

**Flexible applications** - Because apps read behavior from templates and Permits, you can customize and share configurations without changing code.

**Open and auditable** - Everything is open source. You can see exactly how it works.

## Sthalam: Extended Web Merge Capabilities

Sthalam is our first Extended Web application - demonstrating three fundamental merge patterns that enable unlimited applications:

### The Three Merge Patterns

**1. Pull-Only (Read-Only Sync)**
- **How it works**: Publisher updates → viewer receives → viewer cannot send back
- **Merge behavior**: Unidirectional, viewer reads Permit facts to pull updates
- **Sample applications**: Blogs, newsletters, public content, read-only dashboards
- **Capability**: `viewer` in Permit facts

**2. Push-Only (Append-Only Sync)**
- **How it works**: Viewer submits → publisher receives → viewer doesn't see others' submissions
- **Merge behavior**: Unidirectional append, Loro CRDT handles ordering
- **Sample applications**: Forms, surveys, feedback collection, submissions
- **Capability**: `submitter` in Permit facts

**3. Bidirectional (Collaborative Sync)**
- **How it works**: All participants edit → Loro CRDT merges automatically → everyone converges
- **Merge behavior**: Multi-way merge, conflict-free convergence
- **Sample applications**: Messaging, group threads, collaborative editing, password sharing, games
- **Capability**: `collaborator` in Permit facts

### Infinitely Customizable

These patterns combine through **HUML templates** and **Permit facts**:
- Define custom document names (not hardcoded)
- Specify merge behavior per document
- Frontend reads Permits to determine sync logic
- Build anything: messaging apps, games (DX Ball!), commerce, workflows

**Examples in `/sthalam/docs/examples`:**
- Forms/submissions (push-only pattern)
- Comments (bidirectional pattern)
- Publishing (pull-only pattern)

**Safe Interactivity:**
- **CEL expressions** - sandboxed, safe (no arbitrary code execution like JavaScript)
- Every app needs interactivity, but exposing JavaScript is a security threat
- CEL provides reactivity without security risks

**High Performance:**
- **Loro CRDT** - automatic conflict-free merging
- **CEL compiled to GPU shaders** - 500+ FPS canvas rendering
- **OCaml transpiler** produces WebAssembly (40x faster than JavaScript)

The merge patterns are fundamental. Applications are combinations of these patterns with safe, customizable HUML templates.

## Looking Ahead: Verifiable and Auditable

The Extended Web's cryptographic foundation enables important future capabilities.

Adding blockchain integration will provide:
- **Global discovery** - Find people and resources without centralized directories
- **Verifiability** - Cryptographic proof of ownership and authorization history
- **Auditability** - Transparent permission chains that prevent misuse while preserving privacy
- **Traceability** - Track how permissions flow through delegation

This isn't optional - it's essential for making decentralized systems trustworthy and preventing abuse. Your identity and resource ownership records live on-chain (as ERC-5192 Soulbound NFTs and ERC-721 tokens). Your actual content stays local, encrypted, and under your control.

## Built for Individuals

The Extended Web is designed for personal sovereignty, not enterprise deployment. It's for individuals who want:

- Complete control over their digital identity
- Direct relationships without intermediaries
- Applications that work for them, not for advertisers or shareholders
- The ability to collaborate and share while maintaining independence

If that describes what you're looking for, welcome. The Extended Web is for you.

**This is how applications work when sovereignty comes first.**
